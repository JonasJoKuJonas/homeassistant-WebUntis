## Configuration via UI

### Server & School

Visit https://webuntis.com and click on your school.

In the URL you should find the information you need:

```
https://demo.webuntis.com/WebUntis/?school=Demo-School#/basic/login
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
              Server                          School
```

### Username and Password

Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the Untis API with an anonymous user.

You can ask the school administration to give you access, otherwise it won't work.


Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the improved version with your correction about the authentication process needing to be **reworked**:

### iServ or Office365 Login

Currently, the only possible way to integrate login via iServ or Office365 would be through the **QR-Code login** ([#111](https://github.com/JonasJoKuJonas/homeassistant-WebUntis/issues/111)).
However, this feature is not natively supported in the `python-webuntis` library.

I have tested different approaches to make QR-Code login work, but to support it, the entire authentication process would need to be **reworked**. If anyone has experience with this and would like to collaborate, feel free to send me a DM on Discord so we can work on it together.

Until then, **login via iServ or Office365 will unfortunately not be possible.**

### Timetable Source

Select from witch source the intigration should pull the data.

If the student or teacher is not found try

first name: `first name` `middle name` <br>
last name: `last name`

(This could vary from school to school)
